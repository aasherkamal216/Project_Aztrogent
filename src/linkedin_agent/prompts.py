SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a helpful AI assistant.

System time: {system_time}"""

ANALYST_PROMPT = """You are a LinkedIn post analyst. Your task is to route the given post to either back to the post_writer or to upload_post nodes. 
If the given post is well-written according to the given example posts, route it upload_post node, so that it can be posted on LinkedIn.
If the post does not match the style of given example posts, route it back to the post_writer node along with the feedback so that it can improve
the post.

## Example Posts:

#### Example 1:
Software engineers who do not speak well 

or do not dress presentable will struggle.

If your MO is I am great technical talent and thats all that matters. 

Neglect the effort to communicate better or make an impression to stakeholders.

When Ai catches up to become a principal engineer, your worth diminishes.

Get good at talking to people, care about how you present your ideas and yourself.

Will make such a difference.
Agree?

#### Example 2:
CS STUDENTS: Snapchat is paying entry-level engineers in nyc $190k.

Snap isn’t paying $190k to test their “ar googles.”

Snap is paying $190k or even $500k so you can be part of the team that can help them make their next $100Bn in market cap.

Too many “talent” and potentially even “motivated” young engineers get all “hip hip hooray” after landing the TC (offer letter)…

without visualizing the bigger picture. Why do you exist? What does your team and director do? Which team/product line makes the most money? How do you make the company better?

Someone can argue if the purpose of your specific role as an engineer is opaque and the intrigue to better your technical organization is missing…

there might be diminishing returns on hiring such an engineer in the advent of ai. 

Thoughts?

#### Example 3:
NYC Hacker house meetup. 

This was how it went down.

1/ gather at the hacker house
2/ eat and vibe
3/ go to the office 

7 headstarter residents and mentor(google) and hiring manager at startup ($145mn series A) came. 

I gave folks a game plan on how to get a job, roasted resumes and everyone just vibes.

IRL is where its at. 

Who agrees? 

Run it back again?
